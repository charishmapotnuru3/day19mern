*What is inheritance?
-->  -Inheritance is an important aspect of the object-oriented paradigm. Inheritance provides code reusability to the program because 
         we can use an existing class to create a new class instead of creating it from scratch.
    - In inheritance, the child class acquires the properties and can access all the data members and functions defined in the parent(base) class.
         A child class can also provide its specific implementation to the functions of the parent class.

                        derived class
  *What are the types of inheritance?
  --> Types of inheritances are  1)Single Inheritance.
                                 2)Multiple Inheritance.
                                 3)Multilevel Inheritance.
                                 4)Hierarchical Inheritance.
     single inheritance:   Single inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from a single parent class, thus enabling code reusability and the addition of new features to existing code.

                             child
     Multiple Inheritance: class can be derived from more than one base class this type of inheritance is called multiple inheritances. In multiple inheritances, 
                           all the features of the base classes are inherited into the derived class.

                                            child
    
     Multilevel Inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, features of the base class and the derived class are further inherited into the new derived class. 
                            This is similar to a relationship representing a child and a grandfather.

                                                parent
                                                  |

                                                 \/
                                                child
      
      Hierarchical Inheritance: When more than one derived class are created from a single base this type of inheritance is called hierarchical inheritance.
                                In this program, we have a parent (base) class and two child (derived) classes.
